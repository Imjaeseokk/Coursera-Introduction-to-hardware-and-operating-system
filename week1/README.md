- List the four functions of computing
- Describe the benefits of computing

### What's a computer?
> A computer is device or system that includes
> 
> : Hardware, Operating system software, App software, Peripherals, USer


### Classifications
#### By their size and speed
1. Supercomputers
2. Mainframes
3. Minicomputers
4. Microcomputers includes personal computers, laptops, smartphones
   
#### By uses
- General purpose computers: perform day-to-day user input and output tasks
- Special purpose computers: perform specific functions

### Functions of computing
#### Four basic functions
1. Input: gets data in the computer 
2. Processing: happens when the computer receives the input and then converts that data into a format or action
3. Output: makes the data apparent and useful 
4. Storage: is the saving of data to a disk space
   

### Benefits of computing
- Reuse content
- Use network, wireless, cellular
- Apply programming laungauges, processors, and memory
- Save data and documents to storage
- Save digital images for perpetuity
- Edit documents, spreadsheets, and others
